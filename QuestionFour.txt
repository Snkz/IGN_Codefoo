Question 4: "Why do you need IGN and why does IGN need you?"

As a university student, real-work experiences in my field of study are hard to come by. Most students must wait until after their fourth year to really get a taste for what all their studying is trying to prepare them for. That is why I believe an experience like this is so very important to my future. Not only do I get to experience what it's like to be a programmer, I'll also learn valuable insider tips and tricks that will not only boost my confidence but also put me ahead of the curve when compared to my fellow students. An experience like this is one that I do not intend to take lightly and one that I do not intend to merely pass up on. Given the chance, I'm sure I'd come out learning a lot and really getting to be a part of IGN is an honor amongst itself.

On the other hand, I do believe I have many skills to offer to IGN. As an avid gamer and reader of IGN, I am up-to-date on the current needs and hot topics of the industry. On the programming front, I am a Third Year bound Artificial Intelligence student, so I've already been heavily introduced to programming. Teaching someone who's already aware of the standards I'm sure helps in a big way and will ensure time won't be wasted on the nitty-gritty details allowing for more time working with the tools provided. I also believe that I'm a cool guy, and very easy to work with. With a fresh young and even foreign take on ideas and design, someone like me can go a long way in helping IGN achieve its intended goal with the Codefoo internship program. All in all, picking me will not only be a great honor on my end, it'll also be the best decision IGN could make!

PS. As I have just now read your updated job listing, please give me sometime to come up with something truly creative and post it here.
